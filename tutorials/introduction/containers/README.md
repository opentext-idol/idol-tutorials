# Introduction

An introduction to containerized IDOL deployments.

After completing this tutorial, you will have a working end-to-end system, from ingest with NiFi to search with IDOL Find.

## PART I - IDOL containers with Docker

Set up your machine for Docker and download the IDOL Containers Toolkit.

Start [here](./PART_I.md).

## PART II - Configure and run the `basic-idol` deployment

Re-configure IDOL License Server for remote access, and deploy your first end-to-end IDOL system.

Start [here](./PART_II.md).

## PART III - Modify the deployment for your data

Make some targeted changes to your deployment and configuration files to ingest, enrich and search against a set of sample enterprise documents.

Start [here](./PART_III.md).

## Next steps

Explore some advanced IDOL configurations, in the [showcase section](../../README.md#showcase-lessons).

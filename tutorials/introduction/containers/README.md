# Introduction

An introduction to containerized Knowledge Discovery deployments.

After completing this tutorial, you will have a working end-to-end system, from ingest with NiFi to search with Knowledge Discovery Find.

> NOTE: Official Knowledge Discovery software containers are distributed in a Docker repository. A personal key is required to access them. To request a key, contact OpenText support from the [Software Entitlements Portal](https://sld.microfocus.com/mysoftware/index). Alternatively contact your OpenText Account Executive or Partner Manager.

## PART I - Knowledge Discovery containers with Docker

Set up your machine for Docker and download the Knowledge Discovery Containers Toolkit.

Start [Part I](./PART_I.md).

## PART II - Configure and run the `basic-idol` deployment

Re-configure Knowledge Discovery License Server for remote access, and deploy your first end-to-end Knowledge Discovery system.

Start [Part II](./PART_II.md).

## PART III - Modify the deployment for your data

Make some targeted changes to your deployment and configuration files to ingest, enrich and search against a set of sample enterprise documents.

Start [Part III](./PART_III.md).

## PART IV - Ingest your documents for search

With your Knowledge Discovery system now running and configured, you are finally ready to start ingesting data. Explore the indexed content with Knowledge Discovery Find.

Start [Part IV](./PART_IV.md).

## Next steps

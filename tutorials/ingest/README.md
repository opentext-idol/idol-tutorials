# Knowledge Discovery Ingestion

Dip into any of the following showcase guides to try out more ingestion features.

This guide assumes you have already familiarized yourself with Knowledge Discovery by completing the [introductory containers tutorial](../introduction/containers/README.md).

## Preserve your NiFi state

Preserve state outside of the container to keep your changes safe and allow you to modify configurations files.

> NOTE: This lesson is recommended before testing any other ingest features.

[Get started](./preserve-state/README.md).

## Analyze Rich Media

Add the components for audio, image and video processing to your Knowledge Discovery ingest setup. Run OCR on a PDF containing both embedded text and image text.

[Get started](./rich-media/README.md).
